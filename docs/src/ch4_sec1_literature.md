# Literature Review
There are mainly five steps for power network restoration after a partial or full outage:
- Restoration time estimation
- Sectionalization
- Generator start-up optimization
- Path search
- Load pickup

The aforementioned problems have been studied in a separated manner. On the other hand, some researchers are focusing on solving the integrated problems. In addition, many factors such as dynamic security, black-start resource allocation, crew routing and transmission & distribution co-restoration have also been investigated. Here, we will have a brief review of current literature.

It is worth mentioning that there are already review papers on this topic:
- Lindenmeyer, D., H. W. Dommel, and M. M. Adibi. "Power system restorationâ€”a bibliographical survey." International journal of electrical power & energy systems 23, no. 3 (2001): 219-227.
- Liu, Yutian, Rui Fan, and Vladimir Terzija. "Power system restoration: a literature review from 2006 to 2016." Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy 4, no. 3 (2016): 332-341.

In addition, the following paper describes a holistic toolkit with different modules solving aforementioned restoration perspectives:
- Hou, Yunhe, Chen-Ching Liu, Kai Sun, Pei Zhang, Shanshan Liu, and Dean Mizumura. "Computation of milestones for decision support during system restoration." In 2011 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, pp. 1-10. IEEE, 2011.
